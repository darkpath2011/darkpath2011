- ⚡ Cherish the present, cherish life, and cherish every minute and second of today. Reality is far more interesting than the Internet. The Internet is just an outlet for emotions. You should always believe that the Internet is virtual and far from being as interesting and significant as reality. Perhaps being a better self in reality is what we should do.
